# (Odyssey Course) Performance in the Router

Welcome to the starter code for **Performance in the Router**. You can find the [course lessons and instructions](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/router-performance) on Odyssey, [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)'s learning platform.

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step-by-step through what you'll need to do. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

To run this repository, you'll need Docker and Docker Compose.

With those installed, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

```
docker compose up -d
```

This starts the composed Docker process in detached mode. This means the running process will not occupy the terminal where you ran the command. Instead, you can open up the Docker Desktop app to monitor the progress of each container as it boots up.

Once your containers are running, navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the VSCode IDE where we'll do all of our work.
